// Amelia had an ancient scroll, which was a sorted list of mystical numbers. One day, boy named Erik arrived with an integer, K, seeking its place in the scroll. Amelia, helped Erik discover the index at which K should be inserted to preserve the sorted order.
// But there was a twistâ€”K had to be inserted within the boundaries of the scroll, between indices 0 to N-1, or else, the index of K should be set to -1.
// (Assume that the indexing starts from 0).

// Input Format

// The first line consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
// Each test case contains multiple lines of input
// The first line consists of a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the scroll.
// The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the scroll.
// The third line consists of a single integer K which should be inserted the scroll.
// Constraints

// .
// .
// .
// Output Format

// For each test case on a new line, print the index at which K should be inserted such that the sorted order is maintained.
// Sample Input 0

// 2
// 5
// 1 3 5 7 9
// 4
// 3
// 10 20 30
// 40
// Sample Output 0

// 2
// -1
